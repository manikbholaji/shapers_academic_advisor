.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- `app/appointments.py`
- `app/analytics_module.py`
- `app/streamlit_app.py`

## Notes for evaluators

- The app uses saved profile data to shape recommendations and planning suggestions.

- If API secrets are not configured, the app falls back to a deterministic mock coach.

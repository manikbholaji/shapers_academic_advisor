# Basic Maths Prep

Basic Maths Prep is a Streamlit study site for school maths revision. It uses an editorial, split-layout design inspired by the provided sample pages, but all copy and logic are original. The app focuses on topic recommendations, academic planning, practice coaching, and automated appointment scheduling.

## What it includes

- A landing-style dashboard with a profile-led study summary.
- Personalised topic recommendations for numbers, fractions, algebra, geometry, mensuration, and exam strategy.
- Academic planning suggestions, including a weekly study plan and revision timeline.
- A practice lab that can answer maths questions with an AI client or a deterministic fallback.
- Automated appointment scheduling that picks the next available coaching slot.
- Analytics for logged practice interactions.
